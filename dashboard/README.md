# Interactive Dashboard - SpaceX Falcon 9

This dashboard application contains input components such as a drop-down list and a range slider to interact with a pie chart and a scatter plot. To create this dashboard, we will follow these steps:

STEP 1: Add a drop-down input component for the launch site
STEP 2: Add a callback function to generate a success pie chart based on the selected site
STEP 3: Add a range slider to select the payload
STEP 4: Add a callback function to generate the payload success scatter plot
